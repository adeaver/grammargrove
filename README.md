# GrammarGrove

#### Getting started

Currently using Python version 3.10.12, this can be installed using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

You're also going to need to install Django for use of the command line tools.

#### Running the server

```
docker-compose up --build
```

And head over to http://localhost:8000/

#### Running commands

Any management commands can be run with:

```
./scripts/manage {command}
```

This is merely a convenience around `docker exec -it grammargrove-web-1 poetry run ./manage.py {command}`, which needs to be used to interact with the database.
