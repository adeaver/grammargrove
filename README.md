#### Getting started

Currently using Python version 3.10.12, this can be installed using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

You're also going to need to install Django for use of the command line tools.

#### Running the server

```
docker-compose up --build
```

And head over to http://localhost:8000/
